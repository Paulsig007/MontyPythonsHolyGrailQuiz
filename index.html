            Welcome, welcome, welcome, to the one, the only, Monty Python's Holy
            Grail Quiz, where most of the questions don't really make sense, and
            the answers, even less so! Here's hoping you liked the movie because
            you're really going to hate this if you didn't. Here's how to play:
          </header>
          <ul>
            <li class="instLi">Click the start button.</li>
            <li class="instLi">
              Answer the questions to the best of your ability.
            </li>
            <li class="instLi">
              Watch out for that scary timer, though, a wrong answer will take
              away 10 seconds. If the time runs out, take one last guess, just
              for fun, it's not like it'll hurt any more than it already does.
            </li>
            <li class="instLi">
              When you're finished, if you finished at all, your time left will
              amount to your score.
            </li>
            <li class="instLi">
              After you're done crying about how poorly you did, you can submit
              your initials in the tiny form to save all of your lackluster
              progress.
            </li>
            <li class="instLi">
              Feel free to click the view high scores button to feel even worse
              about things.
            </li>
            <li class="instLi">
              Best of luck to you, we're not expecting much at all.
            </li>
          </ul>
